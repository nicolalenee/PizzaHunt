## Usage
Users are able to sign-in and post about pizza, comment on recipes, and create threads within the comments. 

## Technologies
This progressive web application was built with a robust front-end and back-end. The database was created using MongoDB and Mongoose. Using the MVC paradigm, API routes are used to interact with the documents. In order to allow users to have some offline capabilities, IndexedDB was used to store any new data from user input while offline and establish a connection to the database to move that data from the store to the database.
